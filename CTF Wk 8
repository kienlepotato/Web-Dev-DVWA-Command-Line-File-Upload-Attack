CTF â€“ Buffer overflow
Task:
A. using the following C application:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
void winner()
{
 printf("flow changed\n");
}
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
 char buffer[50];
 gets(buffer);
 printf("exit\n");
}
Compile this application and perform a buffer overflow to cause execution of the winner() function.
B. Using the following application:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main (int argc, char** argv){
 //Make a buffer make this bigger than the minimum you will need
 //You will want to make this large enough to fit shell code and lots of nops
 char buffer[500];
 //copy cmdline input into the buffer.
 strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
 //return 0 because that is what we do if stuff exits normally.
 return 0;
}
Execute some shell code to gain a shell as the user who the code is executed as.
C.
Write up what you have done, how you did it and what protections exist to make it hard to do.
